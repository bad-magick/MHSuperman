<h1><a class="anchor" name="todo_s">TODOs</a></h1>all controls properties -&gt; allow operators, also for flags<p>
FORMS MODULE allow adding existing forms like open_form, save_form, etc.<p>
I can allow property-like behavior of calling a member function like list-&gt;item(1)-&gt;whatever = 5; should be able to have somehow getter and then setter (for instance, I could cache the getter)<p>
DOCS- wanna help? you're most welcome! DOCS - convention - every types::type, when used within a class, it's class::type_type like: rebar_band = rebar::band_type<p>
IMPL -&gt; tree tooltip toolbar rebar<p>
how do i end dialog when a button is pressed?<p>

<li>i need to have a module that will allow dealing with raw_hwnd(). by default, this is all hidden<ul>
<li>this besides allowing access to raw_hwnd, will also allow subclassing other windows (not our own), so that we can easily reference them as well</li><li>timeframe</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>events<ul>
<li>handle all events a window exposes - make a class for that</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>find_by_hwnd - we'll search by raw_hwnd - whichh is an internal method</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>put on that site with lots of mfc examples, etc</li></ul>
<p>
in order to minimize the code that i write for parsing events - etc, some stuff will not be parsed. WHAT CAN BE DEFINED AS A FUNCTION, IMPLEMENTED SOMEWHERE ELSE, WILL BE DONE SO (as oppposed to do some parsing and define it inline)<p>
wnd&lt;rebar&gt; w = new_(parent);<p>
-&gt; I can have new_&lt;type&gt;(...) and new_(...); for the second <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a> - allow wnd&lt;type&gt; to be constructed from new_(...) -&gt; new_(...) is a function returning a holder of values) --&gt;up to 10 arguments "wnd&lt;&gt; w = new_(...)" =&gt; this throws - you need to specify the type of window you want to create<p>
the window class - must NOT be copyable<p>
flag classes, properties! can say x.text += "something";<p>
wnd&lt;&gt; w = new_&lt;some_name&gt;(...); every time you use w-&gt;, it checks that the window is valid the difference between<p>
weak_wnd&lt;&gt; - for storing pointer to parent or so.<p>
to delete -&gt; delete_&lt;&gt;<p>
RAII - you get what you ask for = one-window = one-c++-instance. function is_valid(w) and use_even_if_not_valid(w)-&gt;whatever() (just in case you need to release its resources or whatever)<p>
explain why not local variables- what if the user destroys one?.<p>
also - when out of scope, if it's a <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a>, see what to do. wnd&lt;&gt; f = new_&lt;some_form&gt;(...); how do i keep this on screen? (taht is, after scope is exited)<p>
control versus <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a> - only for a <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a>, you can access its children. a control can be a <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a>.<p>
At one time, you can end up with multiple wnd&lt;&gt; pointers<p>
About multiple wnd&lt;&gt; pointers – a c++ exception, as opposed to a possible crash. The weak_wnd&lt;&gt; class<p>
Dealing with windows – the basics<p>
When dealing with windows, you’ll always use the wnd&lt;&gt; or the weak_wnd&lt;&gt; templated classes: • wnd&lt;&gt; - represents a shared (ref counted) pointer to a window • weak_wnd&lt;&gt; - represents a weak pointer to a window<p>
The wnd&lt;&gt;/weak_wnd&lt;&gt; classes have one optional argument – the window type. This is pretty much what you’d expect: by default, it’s window_base. Or it can be a window class: text, label, rebar, edit_box, etc.<p>
Usually you’ll always deal with wnd&lt;&gt; objects. Internally, each such object maintains a ref counted pointer to the C++ instance corresponding to the on-the-screen object. When you need to avoid circular references, you can use weak_wnd&lt;&gt;.<p>
wnd&lt;&gt; and try_wnd&lt;&gt; -&gt; need to work for raw pointers as well - in case we use them within our member methods self() - cannot be used in the constructor --- depending on what you want to do, you can do it on on_create()<p>
I will have a solution that contains ALL PROJECTS, and allows compilation debug/release/unicode debug/unicode release after that, depending on what the user includes, have pragma comment lib<p>
commctrl -&gt; don't have _WINNT blabla. WinXP and WinVista.<p>
creation of a window - if rect is not specified = all parent's scrren<p>
LoadAccelerators - try with the closest <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a>; if not, the higher <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a> until reaching the top.<p>
tab control: one_dialog_per_tab have <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1property.html">property</a> : "count" , like tab-&gt;count = 5; in this case, I will take the last added <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a>, and copy it in as many pieces as needed. if at this time tab-&gt;count = 0 -&gt; exception will be thrown probably i will need to have a way to clone a <a class="el" href="structegui_1_1form.html">form</a> and/or control for this matter this needs to work EVEN IF THERE'S NO DEFAULT constructor --&gt; need to copy all properties - in other words, properties need to be somehow copy constructible TOTHINK!!! <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Jun 2 10:04:32 2008 by&nbsp;
