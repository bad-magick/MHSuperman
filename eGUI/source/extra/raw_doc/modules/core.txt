-- when refering to children - have functions like raw_child(idx) - to symbolize that you should use something else to get access to children

-- this needs to be very friendly and dependent on the current form
   - should it be accessible in the exterior - I think not - eventually if you want that, just provide your own custom member function

windows:

window - basic concept, just properties, on_create/on_destroy, etc

- form : a form, that holds controls (derives from handle_events::form)
- control : basic widget (might derive from handle_events::control, if there is such a thing)
  - label : control, handle_events::label { ... }
  - ...
  
  
  
  
  
  
explain that the fact that we register the handlers is constructor is way too fast etc
no need to worry about speed at this point - that is, we're c++ - so we're fast anyway
compared to the time it takes to draw windows, what we're doing is child's play.
