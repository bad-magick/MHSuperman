Directory structure:
root = egui/

- if a header is needed by clients of the lib, indirectly, included by one of the 
  public headers, it will be found in:
  egui/core/detail/ 
  - if needed by core, or by multiple unrelated modules
  egui/<modulename>/detail/ 
  - if needed by a specific module, and optionally by other modules that DEPEND on this module
  egui/source/core/detail
  - if needed by the core IMPLEMENTATION
  egui/source/<modulename>/impl 
  - if needed by a specific module



- Each module is found in its own directory:
  egui/<modulename> - the include files
  egui/source/<modulename> - the source files

In the source:
- we have a header that automatically turns on "IMPL" details
  this is defined in all impl files (like, a egui/source/core/detail/fwd.hpp or so)

IMPORTANT:
the user can choose to link against the lib, or simply include its files toghether with the project
it'll still work


--------------------------

each module has its own namespace!

--------------------------
TOP DIRS:
<modulename> - all modules
source - the source files
source/extra - extra files, like tests/samples
