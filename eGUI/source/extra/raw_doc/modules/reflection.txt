allow for reflection.
-- when a control/form is loaded, make sure we can load properties about itself or children of it

-- this should be more general - need to insert/update anything here- anything related to resizing/control details/control properties etc.


we need to be able to interact with the vc 2005 gui

-- about events
  - need to figure out the events (this should be easy - a form, the form's events)
  - need to figure out notifications (see its children)
  

-- for each form/control
 - see its type
 - we might have extra properties for a form/control
   - at least, more user-friendly
   - like, some control's background, etc.
   - these need to be kept somewhere
     - also, it should be loaded and processed at runtime
     
     
     
     
- see where i wrote about "configure"
  - i need to have sections like "resize { ... } props { ... } " 
  - within "resize" for instance, I can have things like username.x = passw.x;
    username & passw -> identify controls by _form_resource() . -> each control has 2 things: a name ("username") an id( IDC_username for instance)
    this way i can match a string to an id, within a form.    
     
     
- existing properties should be reflectable.
